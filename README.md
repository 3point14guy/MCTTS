This repo is for me following along with Petr Tichy (Ihatetomatoes) youtube series about Webpack 2. It starts here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdGnYNtuEtE>

Right in the first video I had some problems following along becuase I was getting the error: webpack: command not found.  I went to <https://webpack.js.org/guides> and followed there install guide.  I thought I found that the reason the webpack command was not working because there was no script built for it yet in package.json, but I still can't use the command webpack. Wherever you see and hear Petr using webpack, it can be replaced with ./node_modules/.bin/webpack and this will work, however.
